This benchmarks XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression on publicly available credit datasets, evaluating both predictive performance and interpretability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
The goal is to develop machine learning models that are both accurate and explainable to support fair and regulatory-compliant lending decisions.

# Key Features

- Multi-model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- SHAP summary, waterfall, and feature importance plots
- Comparative metrics: AUC, F1-score, Recall
- Explainability focus under class imbalance
- Real-world finance application: Retail credit risk scoring

# Datasets Used

- [German Credit Data – UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data))
- [Home Credit Default Risk – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk)
- [Give Me Some Credit – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit)
